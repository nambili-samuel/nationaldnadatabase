<p>A <a href="https://nambili-samuel.github.io/DNAdatabase/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DNA database</a> is a computer-based system containing biological information, or '<a href="https://www.biodata.pt/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bio-data</a>,' regulated and maintained by the government or controlled by a private entity. This technology is a must-have tool in facilitating state machinery such as police, immigration, forensics, healthcare, and national security apparatus.</p>

<p>This system has scored high in countries that have already deployed DNA technology in efforts for crime prevention, analysis, monitoring, investigations, deterrence, and identification. Today, many countries worldwide are turning to DNA technologies, including <a href="https://visitnamibia.com.na/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Namibia</a>'s neighboring nations such as Botswana, South Africa, and Tanzania, which are planning to establish their centers.</p> <p>The benefits of using a DNA database outweigh the gravity of the negatives and common skepticism posited by several civil activists. While the technology may be perceived as an invasion of privacy, its implementation seeks to combat crime and act as a deterrence.</p>

## Introduction

<p>Welcome to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180805191816/http://nambilisamuel.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">National DNA Database</a>! DNA databases has become modern forensic instruments used to resolve multiple crime convictions, exonerate wrongly accused individuals, identify missing people, settle paternalistic disputes among families, and assist medical examiners in identifying bodies that are burned or decomposed beyond recognition, as in the case of examining the remains of victims of the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/event/September-11-attacks" target="_blank" rel="noopener">September 11th disaster</a> where bodies were completely burned.</p>
<p>As a physician, bioinformatician, and medical researcher, I have developed this project to explain how the project addresses a specific need or problem in the medical field. A national DNA database in a country can shed light on some mysterious crimes, such as those perpetrated by psychopaths like the '<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B1_Butcher" target="_blank" rel="noopener">B-1 Butcher</a>,' where most traditional methods fail to produce satisfactory solutions.</p>
<p>The advancement of national investigative technologies is a priority, as the criminal landscape is becoming increasingly complex. It is important to ensure that special technologies like these are within our reach. DNA technology is a game-changer in criminal intelligence and solving cases that are sometimes too complex for conventional means. The system can open doors for new and wonderful innovations, particularly in genetic research.</p>

## Features

- **Genetic Profiles:** This feature allows users to create and manage genetic profiles, including storing genetic data, annotations, and metadata. Users can easily analyze and interpret genetic information for research and clinical purposes.

- **Search and Matching:** The search and matching feature enables users to search and match genetic profiles based on specific criteria, such as genetic variants, phenotypic traits, or demographic information. This functionality helps researchers and clinicians identify relevant genetic profiles for their studies or patient care.

- **Data Entry:** With the data entry feature, users can input and update genetic data, phenotypic information, and other relevant data fields. This feature ensures accurate and comprehensive data collection, facilitating robust genetic analysis and research.

- **Access Controls:** Access controls allow administrators to manage user permissions and access levels within the system. This feature ensures data security and privacy by restricting access to sensitive genetic information based on user roles and permissions.
